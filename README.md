# Spam Soaker 2000- A simple little Naive Bayes spam filter

This is just a very standard spam filter using Multinomial Naive Bayes. The model is trained using a dataset containing 5572 SMS messages, and is available at the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection">UCI Machine Learning Repository<a>. I have also included some swanky LaTeX to show exactly how the formula used in the model is derived using Bayes' Theorem.
